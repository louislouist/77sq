Reminders::
via indexing 
SELECT * FROM tracking_sessions WHERE session_id = 'abc123';
SELECT * FROM tracking_sessions WHERE aircraft_id = 42;

//first
SELECT * FROM tracking_sessions WHERE session_id = ? ORDER BY seqNr ASC LIMIT 1;
// last
SELECT * FROM tracking_sessions WHERE session_id = ? ORDER BY seqNr DESC LIMIT 1;

Done::
::loop for following emergencies

	start tracking loop.
		set an array that holds hex, count, lastSeen: datetime;
		fetch updateloop runs inside
		 if no hex, set hexID and use that hexID for database, etc
		 if ac[n].hex is in fetch, update count & lastseen: 
		 else if lastseen > 1 hour, remove ac[n].hex;

	if ac > 0... change loop time to every six secconds.
	if ac =< 0... change loop to 1 minute.

	create an array that puts any ac[n].hex into tracking.
		once ac[n].hex leaves the array, for 1 hour that aircraft will not be elegable for socials.
	
	on first sighting to array and not in tracking.array
		post to socials and write console and begin writing each 6 second update to db.
Give tracking an id uuid for tracking the event#
figure out schemas.
